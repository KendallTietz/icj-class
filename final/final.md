# Your final project

Your goal with this final project is to create a multi-page website that has an index and multiple detail pages. You'll start with the [icj-project-template](https://github.com/utdata/icj-project-template) and publish to Github Pages.

I'll supply you with a project idea and assets. You are allowed to use your own material and project, provided it has all of the components below.

## Requirements

- A base layout that is extended throughout the project
- A detail layout that is then extended to two or more pages
- At least one partial that is included into another layout template
- A data collection that is used in a loop of repeating code
- The project must use the following Bootstrap components: [Responsive images](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/content/images/), [Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/jumbotron/), [Navbar/Navs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/navbar/), [Media object](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/media-object/).
- You must choose and use a Bootstrap component not already in that list.
- You must use at least one scss partial with your Sass code.
- You must use at least one [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/).
- This should all be in its own repo, published through Github Pages.

Everything should look beautiful and be functional.

## Assets available

For a project, you can build a band website for the rock band Queen. An index with an overview and discography of their studio albums. Detail pages for each band member with biographical data and a explanation of their role.

Available for you to use:

- A [spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rT71c8CXtx3x2ak6nawjpAGukLNLo1lrbLuvjvZ9zFE) of member information and discography that can be [turned into JSON](https://www.csvjson.com/csv2json) data.
- A collection of album cover photos
- A collection of member photos
- You can harvest (and credit) information from Wikipedia.

## Deadlines

Canvas is the final word on deadlines, but in general there are in this order:

- A sketch of your index and detail layouts
- Working HTML templates
- Functioning data; start on CSS changes
- In-class presentation of progress on last day

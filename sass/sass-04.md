# Publish the /doc folder to the web

Because we put our web site files inside a `docs` folder, we can take advantage of a special feature in Github called [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It will allow us to publish our site to the internet.

- Go into your Github repo for this project
- Click on the Settings link
- Go down to the Github Pages section, and in the **Source** dropdown, choose **Master branch /docs folder**.
- Click Save

Once the page refreshes, it will give you a link to where you can find your site. It works like this:

`https://YOUR-USER-NAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME/index.html`

There are other ways to use Github pages to host websites and blogs, and it's free.

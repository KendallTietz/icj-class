# The Node.js ecosystem

Some day we might write a separate lesson on what Node is and how it works. Here is some copy to start with:

**Node.js** is an open-source programming framework built using JavaScript. Many programmers like it because it allows them to write JavaScript not just in their browser for “front-end” tasks, but also in the terminal or on a server for “back-end” tasks.

For our purposes, Node is really an ecosystem to use a bunch of mini-programs built in JavaScript. Developers will create these mini-programs -- known as packages -- in that ecosystem and then share them with the world through **npm**. Node Package Manager, or npm for short, is like the iTunes Store for these packages. When someone creates a package to do something -- say a photo slide-show for the web -- and then shares it on npm, then we don't have to reinvent that wheel.

# Functions with flow control

Now that we have a handle on how functions can work, we're going to have our functions make decisions based on values we've given it.

Given our name function we made in our last lesson, what 

THIS AINT DONE.

<!-- **Bonus** using your function from earlier that joins names: can you write a function that knows to put a period after the middle name if it's only one character long? Hint: try testing the `.length` property using an `if` statement -->

## Functions with flow control

What if the middle name is blank? How can we avoid the extra space?


### Flow control functions on your own

1. Write a function that takes two scores - `home` and `away` - and logs a message to the console saying either **"The home team won"** or **"The away team won"**
2. in your code, call it twice to make sure it's working - once for a time when when the home wins and once for when it loses
3. what if it's a tie? use `else if` to handle ties and call it again to make sure it works

# HTML homework assignment

For this homework assignment you are coding a story in HTML as indicated below. Points will be taken off for improper syntax and indentation. Make clean code.

There are cases in this homework where we have NOT covered a specific HTML tag in class. You will need to look it up. (Google!!!)

You will need to create a new, public Github repo with a README for this assignment. Call it something like `yourname-sports-story`. When you clone your repo to your computer, make sure you then go INSIDE your new folder.

- In your repo, create a new file named `homework-story.html`. Make sure it has all the proper HTML5 tags like doctype, title, head, body, etc.
- Use [this text file](html-homework-text.txt) for the starting body text.
- Code the overline (the text "OPEN THREADS") as an `<h4>`.
- Code the main headline and the subhead with the proper hierarchy of header tags. (i.e., the main headline should be bigger than the subhead).
- Code the subhead that is in the story "Under the radar" with the proper hierarchy of header tags. 
- Properly link the byline to the included Twitter handle.
- Put the date in a `<span>` tag.
- Add an image after the byline, using [this url](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IY3HGJq67arSfFw-sn8NpvFl0A0=/0x0:5760x3840/920x613/filters:focal(2420x1460:3340x2380):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/60729315/usa_today_10365328.0.jpg) for the source.
- Create a credit line with the text "Soobum Im-USA TODAY Sports" in a `<p>` tag with a class of "credit" under the image.
- Style all the text in `<p>` tags.
- There is a quoted text paragraph that starts with "Granted, not every starting ...". Put that in a `blockquote` tag. Don't know that one? Look it up.
- Add a hypertext link to the text "ranking the starting five line-ups" to [this url](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2789035-ranking-every-nba-teams-projected-starting-5-after-free-agency#slide7), opening in a new window.
- Use an ORDERED list for the ranking list of teams in the middle of the story, but it should start with the Philadelphia 76ers as number 5. Don't know how to do that? Figure it out.
- Make sure the last two paragraphs are in a `<div>` with an attribute "comment-notes".
- Once you are done with the HTML, create a `.gitignore` file like we did in class, then use the git cycle to save and push all your changes to Github. Submit the link to your repo in the assignment.

# HTML practice assignment

For this practice assignment you are coding a story in HTML as indicated below. Points will be taken off for improper syntax and indentation. Make clean code.

There are cases in this assignment where we have NOT covered a specific HTML tag in class. You will need to look it up. (Google!!!)

## Getting started

- Inside your `icj` folder, you'll need to create a new project folder, called `yourname-html-css-practice`.
- Create a `README.md` file using proper Markdown with a title, the assignment name and the due date.
- Create a `.gitignore` file like we did in class.
- Use the git cycle to add and commit the files.
- Create a new repo in Github with the same name as your local folder. Do NOT include the readme or gitignore.
- In the resulting directions, copy the `git remote add ...` and use that to connect your local repo to the Github repo.
- `git push` to the repo and make sure it works.

## The assignment requirements

- In your repo, create a new file named `practice-story.html`. Make sure it has all the proper HTML5 tags like doctype, title, head, body, etc.
- Use [this text file](html-practice-text.txt) for the starting body text.
- Code the overline (the text "OPEN THREADS") as an `<h4>`.
- Code the main headline and the subhead with the proper hierarchy of header tags. (i.e., the main headline should be bigger than the subhead).
- Code the subhead that is in the story "Under the radar" with the proper hierarchy of header tags. 
- Properly link the byline to the included Twitter handle.
- Put the date in a `<span>` tag.
- After the byline, add an image tag. Download [this image](https://github.com/utdata/icj-class/blob/master/html/spurs.jpg) in your folder and then use it as the src in your image tag.
- Create a credit line with the text "Soobum Im / USA TODAY Sports" in a `<p>` tag with a class of "credit" under the image.
- Style all the text in `<p>` tags.
- There is a quoted text paragraph that starts with "Granted, not every starting ...". Put that in a `blockquote` tag. Don't know that one? Look it up.
- Add a hypertext link to the text "ranking the starting five line-ups" to [this url](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2789035-ranking-every-nba-teams-projected-starting-5-after-free-agency#slide7), opening in a new window.
- Use an ORDERED list for the ranking list of teams in the middle of the story, but it should start with the Philadelphia 76ers as number 5. Don't know how to do that? Figure it out.
- The last two paragraphs are the opening for the comments section of the article. Wrap both paragraphs with a `<div>` with an `id="comment-notes"` attribute.

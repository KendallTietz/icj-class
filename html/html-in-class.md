## Create a repo in github

- There are a couple of ways to approach this and it does not matter which path you choose.
  - You can create the repo in Github with a README file and clone to your own `/code/` folder. This is probably the easiest if you are starting fresh.
  - Or, you can create the folder on your computer and initilize the git repo, then create the the repo in github and connect it with the `git remote add origin` command.

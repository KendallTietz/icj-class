# CSS Homeowork: Build a sports story

For this homework assignment, you will be picking up from the last HTML homework assignment and enhancing it with your own CSS, with the directions provided below.

We did many of these things with our in-class assignment. You'll also have to figure out some new things, but that is part of coding.

# Goal

To make a news story, something like this:

## Requirements

- Make sure you update your `homework-story.html` file with any of the feedback provided by your instructor.
- Use a css reset file. You can use the same one we used with the in-class assignment.
- Now that you have a reset css file, you'll need to create a new css file for all your other styles specific to this story.
- Set the base font as "Times New Roman" with acceptable backups. Set the font-size for the body to 62.5%, which is the equivalent of 10px, like we did with the in-class recipe.
- Now set a standard font size for text elements like `<p>` and `<ul>` tags. You'll also want to set a bottom margin on those elements so they don't run up against each other.
- Add an `<article>` tag if you need to, then make the max-width of the article 620px and center it.
- In the HTML, set the width of the photo to 620px using a "width" attribute.
- Use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to find and use a font called "Ubuntu" and add that to your page. You'll need to figure out how to do that, but it isn't difficult.
- Set all your headlines to use that Ubuntu font (with backups) and set headline sizes that make visual sense, but follow convention. (i.e., make sure h1 is the biggest and is used for the article headline.) Make sure you also include the `<h4>` label above the headline.
- Set the byline and photo credit lines to use the font Arial with an appropriate backup. Adjust sizes so they are visually appealing.
- Make the photo credit text right-aligned and nudge up the margin so it sits close but not upon the photo so readers know that is what it goes with.
- For the blockquote, set a solid left border that is grey and 4px thick. Add some padding (20px) between this border and the text.
- For the ordered list style, the numbers should line up with the text in the article. `list-style-position` should help you with this.
- Once you are done with everything, push it to Github.
- Turn in the link to your repo.

## If installing bootstrap using npm from scratch

This [written tutorial](https://coursetro.com/posts/code/130/Learn-Bootstrap-4-Final-in-2018-with-our-Free-Crash-Course) and [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnCmSXCZEpU) is pretty decent, and it uses the tools we use (vscode, node, etc.)

This [set of tutorials](https://scrimba.com/g/gbootstrap4) helps with various bootstrap 4 functions, including working with grids, modals, cards, etc.

```bash
npm init -y # creates package.json defaults
npm install gulp browser-sync gulp-sass --save-dev
npm i bootstrap jquery popper.js --save
```
